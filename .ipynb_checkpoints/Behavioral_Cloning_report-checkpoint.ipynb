    "## Model Architecture and Training Strategy \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following I am documenting how I tackled the problem of choosing and building an architecture and collecting the right data so that the resulting model is able to steer the car in the simulation around the track without getting stuck or crash into something. The structure of this report is kind of a logbook documenting each experiment I performed to improve the networks abilities by adapting the architecture or collecting specific data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Model architecture \n",
    "\n",
    "As suggested I implemented the NVIDIA Dave-2 End-To-End model architecture used in the project DAVE-2. This project is very similar to our attempt to “learn” the car to drive safely on the middle of the road/lane by using three camera images and a steering angle, although the NVIDIA project is of course of a much larger scale and complexity in data. They claim that their architecture design is chosen empirically through a series of experiments with varying layer configurations and had the best success with this presented architecture, so I am going along with it because they had much more data, computational power and time to test many configurations than I have. \n",
    "\n",
    "I started out with the layer architecture according to the blog post by NVIDA (https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/) consisting of:\n",
    "- 5 Convolutional Layer\n",
    "- 3 Fully Connected Layer\n",
    "- RELU Activations\n",
    "- MSE Loss Function and \n",
    "- AdamOptimizer (no manual learning rate set)\n",
    "\n",
    "First without using any dropout layer or regularizations and then added drop out to the connected layers with 20% dropout chance. I divided my collected data set into 80% training data and 20% validation data.    "

    "## Data collection strategies \n",
    "\n",
    "I identified three different types of road on the track: \n",
    "- “Normal road” with yellow lane markings and a gutter like structural road limitation, dark pavement \n",
    "- Red/White road markings at curves, dark pavement \n",
    "- Bridge with a cobblestones like road surface and a wall as structural road limitation \n",
    "- Road parts without a boarder or markings, dark pavement \n",
    "\n",
    "![Road types track 1](./00_road_types_track1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The lightning conditions does not vary very much when the car is driving around the track. A very strong environment lightning is applied to the simulation because there are no drop shadows at all, which is an ideal scenario for applications using edge information. The only shadow I see, is when the car is turning into the direction of the light source the cars rear side is getting slightly darker. Therefore I think I do not have to take into account lightning very much.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The car should learn to\n",
    "- Drive in the middle of the road at all of these identified road types\n",
    "- Learn to steer away from the road edge if it runs towards it (recovery data)\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is going to form weights for two different tasks: Some kind of feature extractor for the road boundaries and a steering controller to keep the car in the human “comfort zone”. Because of that, on one hand each of these road segments have to be present in the data in a more or less balances relationship, on the other hand the car also has to learn different steering angles in different car poses to the road edge, which also has to be balanced. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think balancing of the dataset is a crucial part of this project. Steering angles have to be in balance for each road class and each road class has to be in balance to each other. The steering angles can easily be plotted for the whole dataset but it does not give any information if the steering angles are distributed well per road class. Additional labeling of the road type for each frame would make this possible and could be done by hand. :) But this is not an option. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the cars longitudinal axis has a very steep angle to the road edge, it should apply a large steering angle towards the middle of the road. If the car longitudinal axis has a flat angle to the road boundaries, it should keep the steering angle constant or small. \n",
    "\n",
    "I assume that the virtual cameras are pointing exactly into the direction of the cars longitudinal axis, so that the car is driving exactly into the direction of the cameras z-Axis when the steering angle is zero. Additionally I suppose the simulation takes care about the extrinsic calibration of the  camera to the car chassis (maybe it is done according to ISO 8855?).Otherwise we would have take account of the extrinsic calibration of the cameras to the car chassis too. \n",
    "\n",
    "I collected a small dataset of \n",
    "- driving at the track center\n",
    "- driving through all narrow curves\n",
    "- driving over the bridge and\n",
    "- driving along parts without road markings or edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "I figured out that I actually do not have to drive the car to collect data because the velocity/throttle is not used (or at least not required to use) in the training of the model because it is set anyway by the driver.py script. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to collect recovery data I placed the car in different angles to the road edge, set a driving angle towards the middle of the road and took very short catches of these static scenes. That way I generated recovery data on the “normal road” with yellow lane markings, in curves with red/white markings, at the road parts without any boundaries and on the bridge. (Unfortunately the steering angle was reset to 0° as I took the screenshots - imagine that the front wheels are pointing into the direction of the middle of the road)\n",

    "![Car positions to the road edge](./00_car_positions.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Data augmentation \n",
    "\n",
    "By applying horizontal flipping on center, left and right image I generate additional augmented data for my network. This should help to generalize and balance the data in respect to the steering angles. Otherwise because it is a circle track, steering angles would mainly point into one direction if I train the network only in clockwise or counter clockwise direction of the track. \n",
    "\n",
    "If this data augmentation is not sufficient to generate enough data, there are several way to produce more augmented data: \n",
    "- Adding a jitter to the images \n",
    "- Applying affine transformations to the images, like translating the images futher to the right or to the left --> Keep in mind that then a correction factor has to be applied to the steering angle too \n",
    "- Adding \"shadows\" to the images by altering the brightness of parts of the image \n",
    "\n",
    "The keras ImageDataGenerator could be used to apply these augmentations online and generate a randomly augmented batch for each epoch. That way each epoch a entirely new augmented dataset is generated never looking the same as the last one. This is kind of taking pictures out of a never depleating dataset of new images, which seems to be a powerful way to generalize a small dataset. \n",

The training took about 220 seconds per epoch on my old i5 laptop and I ran seven epochs. The Steering angles are distributed around 0 as expected because of the horizontal flip and it looks almost like the beloved Gaussian Distribution. :) The two peaks at 0.24 and -0.24 are because thats the smallest angles I managed to set with mouse steering and the track does not contain a really straight part and lot of parts with small curvature where I had slightly to steer right or left.

The car even recovers to the middle of the road when I provoke drifting out to the side of the road manually. I am very impressed that this works so good, the driving is a little bit shaky but keeps the car very stable at the middle of the road. \n",
